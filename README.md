# icalendar-scheduling-benchmark

Implementing RFC5545 and subsequent? Test for completeness and edge cases, contribute your findings.

## Versioning

We follow a calendar versioning scheme so it is easier to track if updates are required: `YYYY.MM.DD`
Each version fixes the test cases so that other packages can build on top of that and claim compatibility to a certain version.
